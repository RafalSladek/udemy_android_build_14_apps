Why learn to make Android apps?

Android is by far the biggest mobile platform in the world, with around 80% market share and over 1 billion devices sold in 2014 alone.
Not only that, but you can develop for Android on a Windows, Mac or Linux computer.
Java is a great language to learn, allowing you to make apps for PC, Mac and the web, as well as Android.
Android app discovery is far superior to the App Store, meaning that your app has a much better chance of making it big.
Ad-based revenue is more common on Android than on iOS, and easy to set up with Google Ads.
"I love the combination of 'do it yourself if you can' while 'i'll be here after you try'. The videos are not long or exhaustive, but informative and easy to return to. Also, love the fact Rob keeps updating them. It's great to know he keeps updating with Apple (as tough as it must be on him) and protects my investment."

Who is this for?

Anyone who wants to learn to code: Java is a fantastic language to learn how to code with.
Anyone who wants to be an app developer: This is a complete course, just like my Complete Web, iOS and Apple Watch courses. It will teach you how to make money from your apps as well as how to code.
Anyone who wants to understand how computers work: Learning to code is so much more than being able to make apps - knowing how computers work is your key to a hugely powerful world.
